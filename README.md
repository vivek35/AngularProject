# Angular 4 Basics:
4 things required  for Angular 4 setup:
1.	NodeJS
2.	Npm
3.	Angular CLI
4.	IDE.  
  
How to check node installed on your system:
```bash
$ node -v
```
How to install angular CLI on your system:
```bash
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```
How to create project in angular:
```bash
$ ng new <app-name>
```
```bash
 $ cd <app-name>
```
```bash
$ ng serve
```

### Folder Structure:  

* e2e module: This is end to end test folder. This folder is used for integration testing and makes sure application works fine.

* node-modules – npm package is installed in this module. 

* src – This is the source folder of your application. We work with this when working on your application.
* angular-cli.json – This file contain project_name, angular-cli version etc details.
* .editorconfig – This contains config of your editor
* .gitignore – This file contains files that should not be uploaded on git
* package.json – this file tells which libraries will be installed in node_modules when you run npm install.
* karma.conf.js – this file is used for unit testing via protractor. All information required for the project is provided in karma.conf.js.
* app.module.ts – This file has import statement for libraries which is imported by angular-CLI.

It also has variables like:
1.	Declaration: It contains reference to the components in project. AppComponent is component which is created when project is initiated.
2.	Imports: This will have all the modules which is imported. At present , it contains browserModule.
3.	Providers: It contains reference to the services which is used by project.
4.	Bootstrap: This has reference to the default component which is created.

Every Component created has 5 files. Example appComponent
1.	App.module.ts: as explained above.
2.	App.component.css: css defined in this file will be applicable to component defined in html file.
3.	App.component.html : this HTML structure for the component.
4.	App.component.spec.ts : This file is used for unit testing of component.
5.	App.component.ts : The class for component is defined over here. You can do processing of HTML structure in .ts file. The processing will include activities  like connecting to database, interacting with other components , routing, services etc.  

App.component.ts:
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
   selector: 'app-root',
   templateUrl: './app.component.html',
   styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
   title = 'app';
}
```
Index.html
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang = "en">
   <head>
      <meta charset = "utf-8">
      <title>HTTP Search Param</title>
      <base href = "/">
      <link href = "https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">
      <link href = "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto|Roboto+Mono" rel="stylesheet">
      <link href = "styles.c7c7b8bf22964ff954d3.bundle.css" rel="stylesheet">
      <meta name = "viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
      <link rel = "icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
   </head>
   
   <body>
      <app-root></app-root>
   </body>
</html>
```
<app-root> is the selector we defined in app.component.ts.  
  
Main.ts: It is the file from where we start our project development. It has  module which we need during development that is :  

1.Angular-core  

2.Platform-browser-dynamic  

3.App-component  

4.Environment  


* Environment

1. environment.prod.ts:

```typeScript
export const environment = {
  production: true
};
```

-Set production to true if you want to enable production mode.  

2. environment.ts : 

```bash
	
		export const environment = {
  			production: false
};
```
-Set production to false if you want to do debugging or development.  

### Creating New Component:

Angular – cli:  

```bash
$ ng g component <component-name>
```

This will create a component inside app folder. It will have five files as mentioned above.  

Example: I have created header and footer components:  

```bash
$ ng g component navbar
```  

Now if you check app.module.ts file. Your component will be already added there.  

You will write your html code inside navbar.component.html file:  

```html
<header>
  <h2>Cities</h2>
</header>
```

You will write all your CSS code inside navbar.component.css file:
```
header {
  background-color: #666;
  padding: 30px;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 35px;
  color: white;
}
```

Then you will check navbar.component.ts file 

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-navbar',
  templateUrl: './new-navbar.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./navbar.component.css']
})
export class NavbarComponent implements OnInit {
constructor() { }
 ngOnInit() {
  }
}
```

there you will find:

1.Selector: selector of the component which is to be added in app.component.html  

Example: In case of navbar it will be ‘app-navbar’.  

2. templateUrl: HTML file associated component.  

Example: Incase of navbar it will be ‘navbar.component.html’

3. styleUrls: CSS file associated with component.  

Example: Incase of navbar it will be ‘navbar.component.css’.  

We can also create new html and css file and provide the link of that file inside templateUrl and styleUrls.  

You will also find the new class created with name of your component and it will have constructor and ngOnInit() method:  

Example:
```typescript
export class NavbarComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor() { }
  ngOnInit() {
  }
}
```

NgOnInit method is called by default when class is executed.  

In the same way we have created footer component.  


### Data Binding

Data binding is done using {{}} in <component-name>.component.html.   

You can declare variables in < component-name >.component.ts.   

We will see the example with structural directives like *ngIf , *ngFor.   

We will work on getting to know directives as the project goes on.


So we have created a new component called body.  

In body.component.ts file we have following code:  

```typeScript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-body',
  templateUrl: './body.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./body.component.css']
})
export class BodyComponent implements OnInit {
title="Welcome to Body"
months = ["January", "Feburary", "March", "April", "May", 
            "June", "July", "August", "September",
            "October", "November", "December"];
constructor() { }
ngOnInit() { }
}
```

We have used two variables title and months in BodyComponent class which we will use in body.component.html.   
 
-body.component.html:
```html
	<section>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">London</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Paris</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Tokyo</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
  
  <article>
  	<h1>Welcome to {{title}}</h1>
    <h2>London</h2>
    <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the  United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
    <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
    <select>
    	<option *ngFor="let i of months">{{i}}</option>
    </select>
  </article>
</section>
```

Lets do one with *ngIf 
We will have change in body.component.html
If:
```html
<div>
    	<span *ngIf="isAvailable ">Condition is Valid</span>
    </div>
```
If Else:
```html
<div>
    	<span *ngIf="isAvailable; else Condition1">Condition is Valid</span>
    	<ng-template #condition1>Condition is valid</ng-template>
    </div>
```
If then else:

```html
<div>
    	<span *ngIf="isAvailable;then condition1 else condition2">Condition is Valid</span>
    	<ng-template #condition1>Condition is valid</ng-template>
    	<ng-template #condition2>Condition is invalid</ng-template>
</div>
```
### Event Binding
Event binding is the interaction between user and DOM element.   
Example, 
If we have button on DOM , we can bind event on button click.  
If we have drop down list , we can bind event on option change.  
Etc.

Let’s see an example of event binding on button click. 
We have created a button in body.component.html that will change the title of the page.  
```html
<h1 id="title">Welcome to {{title}}</h1>
<button (click) = "myFunction($event)">
    	Change Title
    </button>
```
(click) is an event and we are binding it to a function called myFunction($event) with parameter $event.  
We have defined myFunction in body.component.ts as follows:  
```typeScript
export class BodyComponent implements OnInit {
	title="Welcome to Body"
	months = ["January", "Feburary", "March", "April", "May", 
            "June", "July", "August", "September",
            "October", "November", "December"];
 isAvailable = true;

    	myFunction(event){           /*We have used it in body.component.html on click event*/
    		document.getElementById("title").innerHTML = "Welcome to Body using Event Binding";
    	}
```
We have written code to change HTML content of h1 tag with id title. 
Don’t get confused with id = title and {{title}}. Former is the identifier of h1 tag while the later is the variable used for databinding.
Now if you check the browser and click the button you will see title change from:    


Welcome to Body
---
To
Welcome to Body using Event Binding
---

You can also get the value of content in console or you can use alertbox with following changes in body.component.ts:

```typeScript
myFunction(event){
    	console.log(event);
	alert(“Button clicked”);
    	}
```
You can have different events like change, keyup, keydown, keypress, mouseenter, mouseleave etc.  
Let’s see one more example of event binding on changing dropdown option.  
 body.component.html:
```html
<select (change) = onmonthchange($event)>
    	<option *ngFor="let i of months">{{i}}</option>
    </select>
```
We have used event change with function onmonthchange($event).  We have defined onmonthchange inside body.component.ts as follows:

body.component.ts

```typeScript
onmonthchange(event){
    	alert(“Month changed to “+event.target.value);
    }
```
Try this it will work.
You can get the list of events for event binding using following url:

### Directives
There are three types of Angular Directives:  
1.	Component Directives:   

Component directives are responsible for how components should be processed , instantiated and used at runtime. All this can be done through class.     

 For the components we have created till now navbar,footer,body if you open <component-name>.component.ts file you will find @Component directive and class.

2.	Structural Directives:  
Structural directives handles manipulating DOM elements. They have * sign before them.
Example,  
 *ngFor – Used as for loop
*ngIf – Used as if , if else , if then else.
    
3.	Attribute Directives:
With attribute directive you can change the look and behavior of DOM element.

Let’s try creating simple custom directive to change font color of DOM element:  

```bash
$ ng g directive <directive-name>
```
	Example, 
	```bash
	$ ng g directive changecolor
	```  
Executing above command will create two files in side app directory:  

1.change-color.directive.ts  

2.change-color-directive.spec.ts  

We will work with change-color.directive.ts and change-color.directive.ts will used for testing.
If you check app.module.ts file changeColor directive will be imported and added in declaration variable.  
app.module.ts  
```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { NavbarComponent } from './navbar/navbar.component';
import { FooterComponent } from './footer/footer.component';
import { BodyComponent } from './body/body.component';
import { ChangeColorDirective } from './change-color.directive';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    NavbarComponent,
    FooterComponent,
    BodyComponent,
    ChangeColorDirective
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Let’s see what’s inside change-color.directive.ts:  
```typescript
import { Directive } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appChangeColor]'
})
export class ChangeColorDirective {
constructor() {   }
}
```  
Now the directive has selector property which is defined in selector variable. Using this selector we can define DOM element and make the changes.  
body.component.html
```html
<div>
 	<span appChangeColor>Welcome to {{title}}.</span>
</div>
```
We are going to change the color of Welcome to Body span element.  
How do we do that?
We will need ElemetRef property which will give us direct access to manipulate DOM element.  
```typescript
import { Directive,ElementRef } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appChangeColor]'
})
export class ChangeColorDirective {
constructor(Element: ElementRef) {
  	console.log(Element);
      Element.nativeElement.style="color:green";
   }
}  
```   
 
Now you check the localhost:4200/#  
Welcome to Body(will be in green)  


But if you use ElementRef to manipulate DOM elements can be vulnerable. As per angular site:  
```
Use this API as the last resort when direct access to DOM is needed. Use templating and data-binding provided by Angular instead. Alternatively you can take a look at Renderer2 which provides API that can safely be used even when direct access to native elements is not supported.  


Relying on direct DOM access creates tight coupling between your application and rendering layers which will make it impossible to separate the two and deploy your application into a web worker.
```  


We can use renderer to manipulate DOM elements safely. As we are changing CSS property only we will make use of setStyle:

body.component.ts:
```typescript
import { Directive,ElementRef, Renderer2 } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appChangeColor]'
})
export class ChangeColorDirective {
 constructor(
    private Element: ElementRef,
    private renderer: Renderer2
  ) { 
  	this.renderer.setStyle(this.Element.nativeElement, 'color', 'blue');
  }
}
```
In the above code we have imported in Renderer2 Api, used it inside renderer variable then setStyle and passed element.nativeElement as parameter.
